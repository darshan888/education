        The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act (RTE), 
        is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities
         of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under
          Article 21a of the Indian Constitution. India became one of 135 countries to make education a 
          fundamental right of every child when the Act came into force on 1 April 2010.

        The Act makes education a fundamental right of every child between the ages of 6 and 14 
        and specifies minimum norms in elementary schools. It requires all private schools to reserve
         25% of seats to children (to be reimbursed by the state as part of the public-private partnership 
         plan). Kids are admitted in to private schools based on economic status or caste based reservations.
          It also prohibits all unrecognised schools from practice, and makes provisions for no donation or
           capitation fees and no interview of the child or parent for admission. The Act also provides that
            no child shall be held back, expelled, or required to pass a board examination until the completion 
        of elementary education. There is also a provision for special training of school drop-outs to 
        bring them up to par with students of the same age.

        The RTE Act requires surveys that will monitor all neighbourhoods, identify children requiring education, and set up facilities for providing it. The World Bank education specialist for India, Sam Carlson, has observed: "The RTE Act is the first legislation in the world that puts the responsibility of ensuring enrolment, attendance and completion on the Government.
         It is the parents' responsibility to send the children to schools in the US and other countries."

        Education in the Indian constitution is a concurrent issue and both centre and states can legislate on the issue. The Act lays down specific responsibilities for the centre, state and local bodies for its implementation. The states have been clamouring that they lack financial capacity to deliver education of appropriate standard in all the schools needed for universal education. 
        Thus it was clear that the central government (which collects most of the revenue) will be required to 
        subsidise the states.

        A committee set up to study the funds requirement and funding initially estimated that INR 1710 billion or 1.71 trillion (US$38.2 billion) across five years was required to implement the Act, and in April 2010 the central government agreed to sharing the funding for implementing the law in the ratio of 65 to 35 between the centre and the states, and a ratio of 90 to 10 for the north-eastern states. However, in mid 2010, this figure was upgraded to INR 2310 billion, and the center agreed to raise its share to 68%. There is some confusion on this, with other media reports stating that the centre's share of the implementation expenses would now be 70%.
         At that rate, most states may not need to increase their education budgets substantially.

        A report on the status of implementation of the Act was released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on the one year anniversary of the Act. The report admits that 8.1 million children in the age group six-14 remain out of school and there’s a shortage of 508,000 teachers country-wide. A shadow report by the RTE Forum representing the leading education networks in the country, however, challenging the findings pointing out that several key legal commitments are falling behind the schedule. The Supreme Court of India has also intervened to demand implementation of the Act in the Northeast. It has also provided the legal basis for ensuring pay parity between teachers in government and government aided schools. Haryana Government has assigned the duties and responsibilities to Block Elementary Education Officers–cum–Block Resource Coordinators (BEEOs-cum-BRCs) for effective
         implementation and continuous monitoring of implementation of Right to Education Act in the State.
